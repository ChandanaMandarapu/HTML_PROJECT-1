            <p>
              "It was in November 1883 that Mambally Bapu made the first cake in
              India at Thalassery in his Royal Biscuit Factory founded in 1880,"
              said P M Sankaran, president, BAKE. There was only one bakery
              other than this in the country then. That was in West Bengal and
              only catered to the British. <time datetime="1883">1883</time>

            <summary>When did Pizzas first appear in India?</summary>
            <p>
              Pizzas entered the Indian food market around the 1980s but it was
              not until 1996 that some American fast food chains set up shop
              with their pan pizzas. Till then, pizza, for most Indians, was a
              bread base topped with tomato ketchup and processed cheese.
